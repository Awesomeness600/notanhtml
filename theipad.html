        <p>In April of 2010 is when the first iPad was released followed by the iPad mini and iPad Pro. These devices run on Apple’s iOS operating system for mobile devices.  This device offered a 9.7-inch display, a multitouch screen, an Apple A4 processor, and 10 hours of battery life.  It is purchasable with storage sizes of 16, 32, 64, or even more GB (Gigabyte) of storage as more iPad’s were released.  The iPad also offers a front and rear-facing camera along with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.  It includes some pre-installed applications such as Messages, Mail, FaceTime, Music, Photos, and the web browser Safari.   The iPad gives the user a larger display, faster processor, and higher resolutions. </p>
