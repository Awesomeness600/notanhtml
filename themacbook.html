        <p> The MacBook was released by Apple in 2006.  It was meant to be a replacement for the iBook which turned out to be an incredibly successful product with profit ranging in the ten millionâ€™s for each year.  The iBook was a product announced in July of 1999 at Macworld in New York.  It was one of the first computers to include an AGP-based graphics card (Accelerated Graphics Port). AGP-based graphics ports were used to accelerate 3D computer graphics.  It was then released and shipped in late-September at the price of $1,599.  The name MacBook originates from the word, Macintosh.  It is a computer that includes the Force Touch trackpad and Intel processor.  There is also the MacBook Pro that has robust internals that would allow users to perform more intensive tasks such as video editing.
