        <p>An Apple Watch is a great device that goes along with the iPhone.  Although telling time is a good reason to purchase an Apple Watch, it is not the only reason.  The Apple Watch includes many features such as the health app which is capable of checking if your heart rate is too slow.  Also, you are able to track how many steps you have taken, make calls, text, and even play some games.  There are many beneficial applications such as the GPS which can be used in the scenario that you are lost.  Another ability the Apple Watch had was to make wireless payments in case you forget your wallet.
